                <h1 class="text-uppercase text-capitalize">10 reasons why Linux !!</h1>
                <img src="../img/blog/blog-post-1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Blog image"/>
                <div class="blog-excerpt open-sans-font pb-5">
                    <p> <Strong>1.completely Free.</Strong></p>


                        <p>The primary benefit is that Linux is free, whereas Windows is not. The price of a Windows license varies depending on whether it is for a desktop or a server. In the case of Linux OS, whether it is for a desktop or a server, the distribution is free. Not only is the operating system free and open-source, but so are the apps that go with it.
                        Because the source code for Windows is not open source, you cannot alter it. The same may be said about proprietary programs that operate on it. In the case of Linux, however, a user can download even the source code of a Linux OS, modify it, and use it for free. Although some Linux distributions charge for support, it is a bargain when compared to the cost of a Windows license.
                    </p>
                        <p> <strong>2.  Best for Newbies and easy to use</strong> </p>
                        
                       <p> Windows is one of the most basic desktops operating systems accessible today. It has outstanding graphical user-friendliness. Despite the fact that Windows has a relatively low learning curve, Linux distros such as Ubuntu, Elementary OS, Linux Mint, and others are working to enhance the user experience so that switching from Windows to Linux is as painless as possible.
                        Linux distributions allow users to pick from a variety of desktop environments, such as Cinnamon, MATE, KDE, Xfce, LXDE, GNOME, and others. If a Windows user wants to switch to Linux, WINE (Wine Is Not an Emulator) can be installed to provide them a Windows-like experience on a Linux machine.
                       </p>

                       <p><strong>3. Reliable</strong></p> 
                        
                        <p>When compared to Windows, Linux is more dependable. With its top-notch architecture and built-in security, Linux will provide unrivaled uptime. Linux distribution developers are quite active and deliver major and small updates regularly. Unix-like systems have a reputation for functioning for years without a single malfunction or a circumstance that necessitates a restart. This is particularly essential when selecting a server system. Linux, being a UNIX-like operating system, will undoubtedly be the best option.
                        </p>

                       <P><strong>4. Hardware</strong></P> 
                        
                        <p>When compared to Windows, Linux computers are recognized for using fewer system resources (RAM, disc space, etc.). Hardware companies have already recognized Linux's popularity and began developing Linux-compatible hardware/drivers. Windows is slower when running on outdated hardware.
                        Lubuntu, Knoppix, LXLE, antiX, and Puppy Linux are the finest Linux distros for elderly computers. Linux can operate on old computers with  low-level hardware specification
                    </p>
                       <p><strong> 5. Software</strong></p>
                        
                       <p> There's no denying that Windows has a sizable commercial program library. Linux, on the other hand, relies on open-source, freely available software. Linux comes with simple package managers that make installing and uninstalling software programs a breeze. Linux, which comes with several nice desktop themes, is unquestionably quicker than Windows.
                        When compared to Windows, the Linux terminal provides a better environment for developers. Programming will benefit greatly from the comprehensive GNU compilers and tools. Administrators can manage software via package managers, and Linux, of course, offers the unmatched CLI interface.
                    </p>
                     <p>  <strong>6. Security</strong> </p>
                        
                      <p>  The  Windows operating system is notorious for getting infected with malware, trojans, and viruses. Due to its intrinsic nature, Linux is practically non-vulnerable and more secure. Commercial anti-virus/anti-malware software is not required for Linux. Linux is a privacy-conscious operating system. It does not produce logs or upload data from your system, unlike Windows. The Windows privacy policy should be clearly understood by the user.
                    </p>
                       <p><strong>7. Freedom </strong></p> 
                        
                        <p> Linux can be used as a desktop, firewall, file server, or web server after installation. Linux gives the user complete control over the operating system. Because Linux is an open-source operating system, it allows users to customize its source code (including application source code) to meet their own needs.
                         Linux allows the user to only install the apps they want (no bloatware). In Linux's huge repository, you have complete flexibility to install open-source software. With Windows, the default desktop theme will boring you, however with Linux, you may pick from a variety of desktop themes. After selecting a Linux distribution from a list of options, you may take a deep breath.
                         You may use the USB live-mode option to check out a Linux distribution before deciding on one. The operating system is not installed on a hard disc when you boot in live mode. Simply go ahead and try it; you will fall in love.
                        </p>

                       <p><strong> 8. Annoying crashes and reboots</strong></p>
                        
                       <p> Occasionally, Windows will display an obnoxious warning stating that the computer has to be rebooted. Aside from the annoying "System is updating." notifications, Windows will confuse you with a variety of updates, including critical, security, definition, update rollup, service pack, tool, and feature pack. I'm not sure how many times Windows rebooted to install an update the last time.
                        On Linux systems, a computer reboot is usually not required when performing a software update or installing/uninstalling applications. The majority of system configuration modifications may be made while the system is up and running.
                    </p>
                       <p><strong>9. Server Segment</strong></p>
                        
                        Linux is deployed on the vast majority of servers, indicating that it is the most resource-efficient option. Linux is being used by competitors as well. Windows servers are being phased out to create a place for Linux servers as software applications migrate to cloud platforms. Linux is used by the vast majority of supercomputers.
                        Though the struggle between Linux and Windows continues on the desktop, Linux emerges as the obvious winner in the server space. Organizations rely on servers because they want their applications to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with no or little downtime. The majority of data centers have already adopted Linux.
                    </p>
                       <p><strong>10. Linux is widely used.</strong></p> 
                        
                      <p> Yes, Linux is widely used. Linux may be found everywhere, from the tiniest gadget to the most powerful supercomputer. Linux will be present in any vehicle, network, phone, medical equipment, airline, TV, satellite, watch, or school tablet. Linus Torvalds, the Linux kernel's creator, could not have predicted such success when he initially wrote the kernel. Linus and Stallman deserve credit for their contributions.
                    </p>
                        
                        
                      <p><strong> Conclusion</strong></p> 
                        
                        <p>Variety is the spice of life, as the saying goes. This is especially true with Linux distributions. There are over 600 active Linux distributions to select from. Each is unique in its own right and serves a distinct purpose. When compared to Windows, Linux distributions provide a lot more flexibility. The causes listed above are only the tip of the iceberg. You can do so much more with Linux than you could with Windows. Linux is more powerful, versatile, secure, dependable, stable, and enjoyable to use than Windows. It's important to remember that free isn't always the greatest option, just as pricey isn't always the best one.
                        When all factors are taken into account, Linux will certainly prevail. There's no reason you shouldn't go with Linux instead of Windows.
                    </p>
